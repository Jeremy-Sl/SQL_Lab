# SQL_Lab

## 🗄️ SQL Server Learning Lab

This repository documents my structured learning journey into Microsoft SQL Server, aimed at building foundational skills in database administration, T-SQL scripting, and performance tuning.

The lab is designed to demonstrate practical, hands-on experience with SQL Server in a home lab environment and track progress toward certification-level knowledge (eventually targeting the DP-300: Administering Relational Databases on Microsoft Azure exam).
